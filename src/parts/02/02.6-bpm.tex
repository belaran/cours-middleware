  \begin{block}{What makes a BRM ?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Repository} %, allowing decision logic to be externalized from core application code
      \item \textbf{Tools} % allowing both technical developers and business experts to define and manage decision logic
      \item \textbf{Runtime environment} %, allowing applications to invoke decision logic managed within the BRMS and execute it using a business rules engine
     \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


%The top benefits of a BRMS include:[2]
\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{What's the point ?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reduced or removed reliance on IT departments for changes in live systems
      \item Increased control over implemented decision logic for compliance and better business management
      \item The ability to express decision logic with increased precision %, using a business vocabulary syntax and graphical rule representations (decision tables, trees, scorecards and flows)
      \item Improved efficiency of processes through increased decision automation
      \item Most BRMS vendors have evolved from rule engine vendors to provide business-usable software development lifecycle solutions, based on declarative definitions.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{Standardisation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item No standard for business rules defined within a BRMS
      \item a standard for a Java Runtime API for rule engines JSR-94.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Other standards (under development)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item OMG Business Motivation Model (BMM): A model of how strategies, processes, rules, etc fit together for business modeling
      \item OMG SBVR: Targets business constraints as opposed to automating business behavior
      \item OMG Production Rule Representation (PRR): Represents rules for production rule systems that make up most BRMS' execution targets
      \item W3C RIF: A family of related rule languages for rule interchange
      \item Many standards, such as domain-specific languages, define their own representation of rules, requiring translations to generic rule engines or their own custom engines.
    \end{itemize}
