  \begin{block}{Caractéristiques principales}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Single Sign-On
%      — enterprise portals can provide single sign-on capabilities between
%      their users and various other systems. This requires a user to authenticate only once.
%      Integration — the connection of functions and data from multiple systems into new
%      components/portlets/web parts with an integrated navigation between these components.
%      Federation — the integration of content provided by other portals, typically through the use
%      of WSRP or similar technologies.
      \item Personalisation par utilisateur % — Users can customize the look and feel of their environment. Customers who are
      %using EIPs can edit and design their own web sites which are full of their own personality and
      %own style; they can also choose the specific content and services they prefer. Also refers to
      %the ability to prioritize most appropriate content based on attributes of the user and
      %metadata of the available content.
%      Personalization — Personalization is more about matching content with the user. Based on a
%      user profile, personalization uses rules to match the "services", or content, to the specific
%      user. To some degree, you can think of the two like this: customization is in hands of the end
%      user, personalization is not. Of course actual personalization is often based on your role or
%      job function within the portal context.
      \item Access Control
%      — the ability for portal to limit specific types of content and services users
%      have access to. For example, a company's proprietary information can be entitled for only
%      company employee access. This access rights may be provided by a portal administrator or by a
%      provisioning process. Access control lists manage the mapping between portal content and
%      services over the portal user base.
      \item Recherche globale à l'entreprise
